# mandms (Meaningfuls and Memorables)

An Android app written in React Native to write down Meaningfuls and Memorables from their courses.

## What is Meaningfuls and Memorables

They are small paragraphs (often 3-4 sentences) about what was meaningful or memorable in that lecture/class. 
Aim is to allow students to write M&Ms on the go to avoid making it a painful task when it builds up at the end of the semester.
If students were to write M&Ms after each lecture/class, they will retain more information from that lecture and they will have
a mini diary to look back to see a timeline of what they did in that course which might prove useful when studying for an exam or
just brushing up on that course.
